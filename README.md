# ExpenseManagement-c
My first C project, which calculates your expenses on the basis of a category. This project allows you to log in to your own user profile, authenticated by a password, and it creates files in the backend for your daily expenses.

It is a menu-driven program which allows you to create a new user profile; add, update, and delete the expenses, and later on provides you with the sum based on date or other data
